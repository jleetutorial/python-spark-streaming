    "Last month I wrote a [series of articles](https://www.rittmanmead.com/blog/2016/12/etl-offload-with-spark-and-amazon-emr-part-5/) in which I looked at the use of Spark for performing data transformation and manipulation. This was in the context of replatforming an existing Oracle-based ETL and datawarehouse solution onto cheaper and more elastic alternatives. The processing that I wrote was very much batch-focussed; read a set of files from block storage ('disk'), process and enrich the data, and write it back to block storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article I am going to look at [Spark Streaming](http://spark.apache.org/streaming/). This is one of several libraries that the [Spark platform](http://spark.apache.org) provides (others include [Spark SQL](http://spark.apache.org/sql/), [Spark MLlib](http://spark.apache.org/mllib/), and [Spark GraphX](http://spark.apache.org/graphx/)). Spark Streaming provides a way of processing \"unbounded\" data - commonly referred to as \"streaming\" data. It does this by breaking it up into microbatches, and supporting windowing capabilities for processing across multiple batches. \n",

    "\n",
    "The use-case I'm going to put together is - almost inevitably for a generic unbounded data example - using Twitter, read from a Kafka topic.  We'll start simply, counting the number of tweets per user within each batch and doing some very simple string manipulations. After that we'll see how to do the same but over a period of time (windowing). In the next blog we'll extend this further into a more useful example, still based on Twitter but demonstrating how to satisfy some real-world requirements in the processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I developed all of this code using Jupyter Notebooks. I've written before about how awesome notebooks are (as well as Jupyter, there's Apache Zeppelin). As well as providing a superb development environment in which the results of code can be seen, Jupyter gives the option to download a Notebook to [Markdown]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), on which this blog runs - so in fact what you're reading here comes natively from the notebook in which I developed the code. Pretty cool.\n",

    "\n",
    "I used the docker image [all-spark-notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/all-spark-notebook) to provide both Jupyter and the Spark runtime environment. The only external aspect was a Kafka cluster that I had already, with tweets from the live Twitter feed on a kafka topic imaginatively called `twitter`. "

    "We need to make sure that the packages we're going to use are available to Spark. Instead of downloading `jar` files and worrying about paths, we can instead use the `--packages` option and specify the group/artifact/version based on what's available on [Maven](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.apache.spark%22%20AND%20a%3A%22spark-streaming-kafka-0-8-assembly_2.11%22) and Spark will handle the downloading. We specify `PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS` for this to get passed correctly when executing from within Jupyter. \n",

    "To run the code in Jupyter, you can put the cursor in each cell and press Shift-Enter to run it each cell at a time -- or you can use menu option `Kernel` -> `Restart & Run All`. When a cell is executing you'll see a `[*]` next to it, and once the execution is complete this changes to `[y]` where `y` is execution step number. Any output from that step will be shown immediately below it.\n",

So instead of counting how many tweets there are every batch (say, 5 seconds), we could instead count how many there are per hour - an hour (/60 minutes/3600 seconds is the _window_ interval). We can perform this count potentially every time the batch runs; how frequently we do the count is known as the _slide_ interval.\n",

This is used to store information between batches if necessary, and also to recover from failures. You need to rework your code into the pattern [shown here](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html#how-to-configure-checkpointing). All the code to be executed by the streaming context goes in a function - which makes it less easy to present in a step-by-step form in a notebook as I have above. "

    "\n",
    "Processing unbounded data sets, or \"stream processing\", is a new way of looking at what has always been done as batch in the past. Whilst intra-day ETL and frequent batch executions have brought latencies down, they are still standalone executions with optional bespoke code in place to handle intra-batch accumulations. With Spark Streaming we have a framework that enables this processing to be done natively and with support as default for both within-batch and across-batch (windowing). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here I used Spark Streaming because of its native support for Python, a language that I am familiar with and is (in my view) more accessible to non-coders than Java or Scala. Jupyter Notebooks are a fantastic environment in which to prototype code, and for a local environment providing both Jupyter and Spark it all you can't beat the Docker image [all-spark-notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/all-spark-notebook). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are other stream processing frameworks and languages out there, including Apache Flink, Kafka Streams, and Apache Beam, to name but three. Apache Storm and Apache Samza are also relevant, but whilst were early to the party seem to crop up less frequently in stream processing discussions and literature nowadays. "
